# About
This is the Capstone project about Apple Vision Pro for the University of Alabama CS495 class. Our project is about creating a visionOS app which allows users to upload or capture an image from Apple Vision Pro and send it to AWS Lambda server where Hugging Face models will be applied to detect objects in an image. 

## Repositories
You will find 3 repositories for this project. 
* apple-vision-pro-main: This repository contains the Swift code for the visionOS app called Discover.
* data-processing-main: This repository includes the Python code for processing data on AWS Lambda server using Hugging Face models.
* project-website: This repository has the code for our project website.
